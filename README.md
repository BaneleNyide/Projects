# 1.Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Sound_Classification.ipynb is for an academic project for comp703 Artificial intelligence.
# 2.Banele+Vuyo.ipynb is an academic project for comp702 Image processing and computer vision put togethor by vuyo sibiya and banele nyide details of this project are listed below it is accompanied by a folder for images (ie:the dataset):
Because of the constraint of having to upload files less than 25mb on github, the 'imgs' folder only has few images and a function is created in the code to augment the images, that is for each image we rotate it in multiple directions, zoom it in order to create different versions of the same image for training a machine learning model.
The code was made using google colab because of limited computational recourses and the notebook was uploaded to github via google colab.
The code blocks should be run sequentially from top to bottom.
A zip file was made available for downloading, on the zip file the code block for augmenting the images is the last code block on the .ipynb file and  must be run after the 1st code block (ie: after importing the libraries) if more images are required for model training.
